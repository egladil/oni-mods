## 4-bit Logic
This mod adds a few extra 4-bit automation circuits:
* 4-bit Input Switch

* Binary adder with carry
* Comparator
* Addressable memory

Potential future additions:
* Shift register
* Other things

## Cloning Bay
This mod adds a building to clone critter eggs using genetic ooze and water. Genetic ooze can be produced in the Molecular Forge.
Cloning recipes are created automatically for all base game critters and any modded critters that provide either `EGG_ID` or `EggId` in their `IEntityConfig` class.

## Fusion Reactor
**Depends on:** Radiation

Adds a Fusion Reactor building to the game. The fusion reactor produces large amounts of heat by fusing hydrogen into helium and requires a steady flow of liquid coolant. See in game database entry for an extended description.

## Gigawatt Wire
Adds three new tiers of wires to the game, and two new power transformers.

### Insulated Wire
This smaller wire can carry up to 5 kW and must be built from highly conductive metals and with an insulating plastic coating. A corresponding wire bridge is also added.

### Mega-Watt Wire
This wire can carry up to 1000 kW and must be built from highly conductive metals and with an insulating plastic coating. A corresponding joint plate is also added.

### Giga-Watt Wire
This wire can carry up to 1000 MW and is built using a mix of ceramic and fullerene that turns superconductive at very low temperatures. The wire will break if it becomes too hot. A corresponding joint plate is also added.

### 100 kW Power Transformer
As the name implies, this transformer can transform 100 kW of electric power. It is 3x3 tiles in size.

### 2 MW Power Transformer
If you ever feel that the 100 kW Power Transformer is too small... This one can transform 2000 kW of electric power and is 3x4 tiles large.

## Hyper Coolant
Hyper Coolant is a liquid with very high heat capacity and thermal conductivity. It can be produced in the Molecular Forge from Super Coolant and Molten Lead.

## Nubrion
A map mod I made quite a while ago. It has not been updated recently.

## Radiation
Adds radiation to the game. This is mostly simulated using the existing germ mechanics, but with some exceptions. For instance radiation can spread between gases, liquids, and solids on its own. It can also spread from inside of pipes to the pipe itself and then out into the environment. It is not possible to disinfect radiation.
Exposure to radiation will cause radiation sickness.

A set of useful tools and functions used by my mods. Provides functionality for easily defining strings, materials, and recipes from yaml among other things.

## Test
Just a dummy test mod
