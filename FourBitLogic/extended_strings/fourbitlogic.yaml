      LOGIC4BITOUTPUT:
        NAME: '4-bit Display'
        EFFECT: 'Shows the 4-bit binary value on its input as a hexadecimal digit'

      LOGIC4BITMEMORY:
        NAME: '4-bit Addressable Memory'
        EFFECT: 'Stores up to 256 different 4-bit values'

          While Read Enable is <b><color=#57b95e>active</b></color> the value at the specified address is output to Data.
          
          On the rising edge when Write Enable goes from <b><color=#f44a47>inactive</b></color> to <b><color=#57b95e>active</b></color> the value on Data is stored at the specified address.
          
          The address is made using Address A for the four lower bits and Address B for the four upper bits.
