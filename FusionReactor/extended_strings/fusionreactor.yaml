      FUSIONREACTOR:
        NAME: 'Fusion Reactor'
        EFFECT: 'Produces immense amounts of heat by fusing <link="HYDROGEN">Hydrogen</link> into <link="HELIUM">Helium</link>'
        DESC: |-
          The <link="FUSIONREACTOR">Fusion Reactor</link> produces heat by fusing <link="HYDROGEN">Hydrogen</link> into <link="HELIUM">Helium</link>. It produces about 1000 <link="HEAT">kDTU</link> and 100 <link="RADIATION">Radiation</link> per gram fuel. All the <link="HEAT">heat</link> and most of the <link="RADIATION">Radiation</link> is injected into the coolant.
          
          It can store up to 1000 g of fuel inside and will consume up to 50 g/s. At this rate it will produce 50000 <link="HEAT">kDTU/s</link> and 5000 <link="RADIATION">Radiation/s</link>. This is enough energy to increase the temperature of:
          • 10 kg/s of <link="WATER">Water</link> by 1195.81 K
          • 10 kg/s of <link="PETROLEUM">Petroleum</link> by 2783.76 K
          • 10 kg/s of <link="SUPERCOOLANT">Super Coolant</link> by 321.27 K
          
          Any <link="LIQUIDS">Liquid</link> can be used as coolant. It can store up to 1000 kg of coolant and requires at least 100 kg to operate. The coolant level has to be managed externally.
          
          Disabling the building will not prevent coolant or fuel to store up inside so care must be taken when shutting it down.
